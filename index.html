        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I am a recent graduate of Appalachian State Univesity in Boone, NC. Here, I majored in biology with a minor in physics and acquired a GIS certficate. As my time at App State came to an end, I discovered my passion for web map development. Since then, I've been constantly working to perfect my skills with coding languages (HTML, CSS, Java) and geospatial software (QGIS, ArcGIS). I am currently based out of Laramie, WY, where I am assisting in research related to the alpine lakes of the Wind River Range, WY. My hobbies include whitewater kayaking, climbing, running, and anything else outside. </p>
        
            <p2> I hope to pursue a graduate level education in biology in the near future. In the meantime, I am seeking to improve on both web map design and website development. That said, if you have any interest in letting me build a map (interactive or static) or website for you, please reach out! </p2>

            <p3> <img src="spongemap.png" class="image1">My most recent map. I designed this static map on ArcMap &copy for App State biology professor, Dr Cara Fiore, to highlight sample sites located along multiple small streams in western North Carolina.</p3>

                    <a href="https://noahestrada5.github.io/FinalProjectWeb/">This map</a> was for my final project in the same course as the two above. Please note that the Colorado Tourism Office did not request this map. Their authorship was included simply for detail for the project.
